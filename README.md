# GUI Themes
 A simple but extensible Theme system for Unity's default GUI. Created mostly for myself to easily integrate a theme system into my projects.
 
 **Features**
 
 * Custom palettes for Colors, Sprites, Selectables(Button, InputField etc.) and TextMeshPro.
 * Localised themes. Instead of the entire project using a single theme, adding a GUI Theme component to any UI GameObject makes all children adhere to that Theme.
 * Components for Images, TextMeshPro, Buttons/any Selectable to easily assign Palettes to GUI.
 * Components stay true to their settings even when used as prefabs, or when changing parents.
 * Extensible architecture to easily add your own Palettes.
 
 **Installation**
 
 Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your system. A git GUI such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) will do as well. We won't actually use Git, but it's still required for the coming steps to work.
 
 1. (Optional) Import TextMeshPro's essential resources from **Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Essential Resources.** Only helpful if you want to use Text Palettes, not required either way.
 1. Open the Package Manager from **Window -> Package Manager**
 1. Click the **"+"** icon on the top left and select **Add package from git URL...**
 1. Paste https://github.com/reshyl/gui-themes.git into the URL field and press enter
 
 **Quickstart**
 
 Nothing as of yet.
 
 **Support**
 
 I don't expect anyone to use this besides me but most of the code is still documented. If you do need any help, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reshylDev).

**Third-Party Notices**

 No third-party tools are used, or are required to run this package (Besides TextMeshPro).
